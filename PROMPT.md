 
**Prompt Title:**  
Develop a Comprehensive "Rosetta Stone" Document for Converting draw.io Diagrams to Mermaid Diagrams

**Objective:**  
Create a detailed, technical document that maps and translates the XML-based structure of draw.io diagrams (including uncompressed/unencoded files) to the text-based syntax of Mermaid. The final deliverable should serve as a reference guide for developers and the community, enabling them to build tools that automatically convert draw.io diagrams to Mermaid (and potentially other open formats).

**Scope and Background:**  
- **draw.io Format Overview:**  
  - Research the structure of draw.io files (typically saved as uncompressed XML with elements like `<mxGraphModel>`, `<root>`, and `<mxCell>`).  
  - Identify key attributes (such as `id`, `value`, `style`, `vertex`, `edge`, and `<mxGeometry>`) and their roles in defining diagram layout, shapes, connectors, and styling.
- **Mermaid Syntax Overview:**  
  - Examine the Mermaid language and its DSL for different diagram types (flowcharts, class diagrams, sequence diagrams, etc.).  
  - Identify Mermaid’s elements for nodes, edges, styling, and layout options.

**Research Tasks:**  
1. **Literature and Source Survey:**  
   - Collect official documentation from diagrams.net (draw.io) and community discussions (e.g., GitHub issues, Stack Overflow posts) regarding the draw.io XML format.  
   - Gather resources on Mermaid’s syntax and examples from its documentation and related blog posts (e.g., “Use Mermaid syntax to create diagrams”).
   
2. **Data Collection and Sample Analysis:**  
   - Compile a diverse set of uncompressed draw.io diagram XML files from public repositories or example collections.  
   - Annotate key components and structure of these files.
   - Collect several representative Mermaid diagram scripts that model similar diagram types.
   
3. **Mapping and Comparative Analysis:**  
   - Systematically map draw.io XML elements to Mermaid constructs. For example:
     - Map the `<mxGraphModel>` and `<root>` structure to the overall Mermaid diagram container.
     - Map `<mxCell>` elements representing vertices to Mermaid nodes.
     - Map `<mxCell>` elements representing edges (with attributes such as `source` and `target`) to Mermaid connectors.
     - Translate style attributes (colors, fonts, shapes) into Mermaid’s styling options.
   - Identify features in draw.io that may have no direct Mermaid equivalent, noting any limitations or necessary compromises.

4. **Algorithm and Conversion Guidelines:**  
   - Propose a method or pseudocode for an automated conversion tool.  
   - Detail how to parse the draw.io XML, extract and map elements, and then output well-formatted Mermaid code.
   - Address error handling, edge cases, and how to deal with grouped or nested elements.

**Document Structure Requirements:**  
The final document (in Markdown) should include the following sections:
- **Introduction:**  
  - Overview of draw.io and Mermaid formats, importance of open formats, and the need for conversion tools.
  
- **Technical Overview of draw.io:**  
  - Detailed description of the draw.io XML format (explanation of `<mxGraphModel>`, `<root>`, `<mxCell>`, `<mxGeometry>`, etc.).
  - Examples of uncompressed draw.io XML with annotations.
  
- **Technical Overview of Mermaid:**  
  - Explanation of Mermaid’s DSL, diagram types, and syntax.
  - Sample Mermaid diagrams corresponding to typical draw.io examples.
  
- **Mapping Guide:**  
  - A tabular/narrative mapping that aligns draw.io elements to their Mermaid counterparts.
  - Annotated examples showing side-by-side comparison (draw.io XML snippet vs. equivalent Mermaid code).
  
- **Conversion Algorithm and Guidelines:**  
  - Step-by-step outline (or pseudocode) of the conversion process.
  - Discussion of challenges, limitations, and potential areas for manual intervention.
  
- **Examples and Case Studies:**  
  - Multiple complete conversion examples from draw.io XML to Mermaid.
  - Analysis of edge cases and suggestions for handling complex diagrams.
  
- **Recommendations for Tool Development:**  
  - Suggestions for libraries, frameworks, or approaches to build an automated converter.
  - Ideas for community collaboration, feedback, and future updates.
  
- **Conclusion and Future Work:**  
  - Summary of key findings and next steps.
  - Proposed mechanisms for maintaining and updating the “Rosetta Stone” as both draw.io and Mermaid evolve.

**Output Requirements:**  
- The final deliverable must be a single, comprehensive Markdown document titled “Rosetta Stone for Converting draw.io Diagrams to Mermaid Diagrams.”  
- It should include clear examples, diagrams, tables, and code snippets.
- All sources and references should be cited accurately using inline citations.

**Community and Maintenance:**  
- Include a section on how to gather community feedback and suggestions.
- Recommend strategies for versioning and updating the document as new features or changes are introduced in draw.io or Mermaid.

**Verification:**  
- Cross-verify mappings with multiple sample files.
- Validate that the conversion guidelines align with both draw.io’s documented XML structure and Mermaid’s current DSL capabilities.
